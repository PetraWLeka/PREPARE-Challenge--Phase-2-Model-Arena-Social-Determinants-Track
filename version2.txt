Achieving a better RMSE for your regression task involves several optimization strategies for both your preprocessing pipeline and the model architecture. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide on how you can improve your results:

Preprocessing Improvements
Feature Engineering:

Interaction Features: Combine features to create interaction terms (e.g., feature1 * feature2).
Polynomial Features: Add polynomial terms for numerical features to capture non-linear relationships.
Domain Knowledge: Add domain-specific derived features that might capture more relevant patterns.
Outlier Treatment:

Check for outliers in the data and apply robust methods (e.g., capping or removing extreme values).
Use a robust scaler like RobustScaler to handle outliers better.
Feature Selection:

Use techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or feature importance analysis from tree-based models to drop irrelevant features.
Drop features with high multicollinearity (e.g., correlation analysis).
Target Transformation:

If the target variable is skewed, consider transformations like log, square root, or Box-Cox.
Imbalanced Data Handling:

If your dataset has imbalanced target values, try balancing the data (e.g., SMOTE for regression).
Model Optimization
For Random Forest:
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use Optuna or GridSearchCV for advanced hyperparameter tuning, exploring parameters like max_features or bootstrap.
Experiment with ensemble approaches like stacking with other regressors.
Feature Importance Analysis:

Analyze feature importance from the trained RandomForest and remove low-importance features.
For Neural Network:
Architecture:

Add more layers or nodes in layers for better representation but balance to avoid overfitting.
Experiment with alternative activation functions (e.g., LeakyReLU, ELU) to handle non-linearities better.
Regularization:

Increase dropout rates to prevent overfitting.
Add L2 regularization to the optimizer to constrain large weights.
Loss Function:

If your target distribution is skewed, consider custom loss functions or weights.
Learning Rate and Optimizer:

Use learning rate schedulers like CosineAnnealingLR or OneCycleLR for more dynamic learning rate adjustments.
Experiment with different optimizers like AdamW, RAdam, or Lookahead.
Batch Size:

Experiment with smaller and larger batch sizes. Larger batches often stabilize gradients, while smaller ones capture nuances.
Input Data Augmentation:

If possible, augment features or target values with noise to encourage robustness.
Data Normalization:

Ensure input data normalization is compatible with neural network expectations. Experiment with other scaling methods.
Validation and Testing
Cross-Validation:

Use K-Fold cross-validation or Stratified K-Fold if the data is imbalanced to ensure stable performance.
Data Split:

Ensure the validation set is representative of the overall data distribution to prevent data leakage.
Advanced Techniques
Model Ensembling:

Combine predictions from Random Forest, Neural Network, and other regressors (e.g., Gradient Boosting) using weighted averages or stacking.
Advanced Neural Network Architectures:

Try architectures like TabNet, TabTransformer, or AutoInt for structured/tabular data.
Pre-trained Embeddings:

For categorical variables, use embeddings to capture better feature representations.
Fine-tuning:

Fine-tune hyperparameters like epochs, batch size, and early stopping patience to avoid under/overfitting.
Next Steps
Focus on Preprocessing:

Improving feature engineering and preprocessing often yields better results than solely tuning the model.
Try Alternative Models:

Models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost often outperform Random Forest on structured data.
Analyze Errors:

Plot residuals to understand where the model struggles (e.g., certain feature ranges or target values).
Experimentation Framework:

Use tools like Weights & Biases or TensorBoard to systematically track experiments and insights.
By iteratively applying these improvements and analyzing their impact, you should see consistent improvements in your RMSE. Let me know which part you'd like to dive deeper into!
